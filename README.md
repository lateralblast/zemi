Information
-----------

Additional handling has been added so the script can be run on machines
without ZFS, of ZFS can be discounted via the -Z option.

Additional handling has been added for running in zones where
prstat -Z is used to calculate available memory.

The -Z and -z options can be set manually to simulate those
otherwise they are set depending on what the environment check finds.
